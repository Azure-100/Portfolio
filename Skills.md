Technical skills

Github and Visual Studio code experince

Additional skills in github had to be acquired to create a portfolio page. Since no solutions to working with md files (on windows) were given in class, I had to reserach how to do so. My solution was to use Visual Studio code to add text and attach hyperlinks in the files. Now my Index page functions as inteneded.

-------
R language basics

All the skills necessary to work in R were learned. This ranges from understanting the basic data types to prepping datasets to work with any ML model. This understanding will be demonstrated in any R code provided on the index page.

-------
Statistical functions

In the C++ data exploration assignment, an in depth understanding of R's statstical functions were learned. This was demonstrated by re creating these funtions in C++. These functions ranged from finding the sum of numeric vector to fiding the covariance and correlation between two numeric vectors.

-------
Linear Models in R

In the Linear Models assignment we were required to learn the following skills:
1. Perform data cleaning and data exploration on medium-sized data sets
2. Perform machine learning using linear models
3. Evaluate model performance
In particular, I performed linear regression on a "Video game with Sales Ratings" dataset to predict if a video game would sell well.
Also, a linear classificaiton model was made on a "Prediciton of Music genre" dataset to deterime if a song would be popular or not.

-------
Linear Models in C++

Deeper understanding of R's models was acquired by the ML algorithms from Scratch assignment. We were required to recreate the models and performance R made on the Titanic dataset in C++.

-------
kNN and Decison Trees in R

In my part of the Searching for Similarity assignment, I was tasked with using kNN and Decision Trees for a "Airbnb price prediction" dataset. The model developed would predict if a listing would be realtively expensive as compared to the rest of the listings.

-------
Basic Python and ML with Python

Since Python was not know to me before the semester, I had to attain skills necessary to work in the envionment. This required me to learn the various sytax rules and how pointers work differently in Python as opposed to Java and C++.

Furthermore, everyting learned with R in the course had to be demonstrated in Python. This is demonstred in the ML with sklearn assignment where we had to make models bases on a provided "Automotives" dataset.
-------
Basic Neural Networks in Python

Neural networks had to be made for both the ML with sklearn assignment and the Image Classification with DL assignments.

In particular, an Image classficaition model was made to tell if a provide imgage was of a pizza or not.

Soft Skills

Creativity
Many creative decisions are necessary to fine tune and otherwise adjust any ML model. It's a long trial and error process, and the best solutions are often the most creative.

-------
Collaboration

The group assignment had us learn how to not only communicate effectively, but to also assist in cross develement efforts. For example, some of the students were able to use the same dataset for their parts of the project. This required us to share both the datasets and our understanding of it.

-------
Analysis/Critical thinking

The results of a tested model have to be thoroughly analyzed in any hope to understand the data. For example, a model might show an incredibly high accuracy on the train data, but it takes a deep analysis to use the rest of the data to figure out the model is over fitting and not suited for new data.

-------
Resourcefulness / Adaptability

Naturally, not everything necessary to do the assignemtns was taught in class. Most notably, only ways of working on jupiter notebooks and md files on mac were provided. As I was using Windows, I had to adapt and find ways to adjust. I've previously mentioned using VS Code on the md files, but the jupiter notebooks only converted easily to pdf on mac. As such, I had to take the ibnyp file directly and find a website to convert it to a pdf.

-------
Time management

All of my assignment were submitted well within the listed due dates. For all of college, I keep a working track of assignmetns and their due dates on a calendar. Naturlly, I take of the most pressing assingmetns first. This could mean it's either due soon or just very difficult and progress needs to be made by certain intervals.
