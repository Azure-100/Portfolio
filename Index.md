As explained in the Skills section, I have demonstred that I have the developed the starting skills necessary to work with machine lerning in the C++, R, and Python languages.

My enthusiasm for ML mostly stems from how useful recommendations to me can be made. For example, I love how Spofify has pretty much perfectly captured my taste in music and can make great recommendations.

In the future, I plan on using ML and AI to help in video game production. Naturally, I don't expect machines to do all the work. I just plan on basically collaborating with an trained AI to get useful recommendations or ideas. For example, many short movies are being made by AI and people mix and match the best ideas it had while making it coherent.

To keep up, I plan on paying attention to and learning what parts of ML and AI people get the most entertainment out of. For example, there's a stremer AI called Neuro sama that will play games, chat with viewers, and sing. As such, my focus will be on anything directly involved with this AI's creation.

I can't exactly say I'm determined to get hired to to ML an AI work. While I do have some interest, I don't think there are any compaines that will let me do what I want to with it. I expect it'll be about more traditional and practical applications.
